# React Native App With Redux and JWT-Powered Authentication API

In the <a href="https://medium.com/@mosesesan/tutorial-react-native-redux-with-crud-operations-cdb449538886">previous</a> tutorial, we created a React Native Quotes app with CRUD operations that uses React Native AsyncStorage for storing our quotes.

For this tutorial series, we will build a quotes app that allows users to:

* register
* log in
* log out
* view all quotes
* add new quotes
* edit an existing quote
* delete an existing book from the list
* like quotes
* add comments to quotes and
* share quotes on Facebook and Twitter

In order to achieve this we will use a JWT-powered authentication API built with PHP and the Laravel framework.

If you have any PHP experience, take a look at the following tutorial to create your own API, if you have no PHP experience, you can use the demo API for testing.

*Please note that this tutorial assumes you have some JavaScript or React Native experience, this tutorial does not explain each line of the code instead it presents you with the code and gives you an overview of what the code does and points out the important parts of the code. I have made the code as simple as possible, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to leave a comment.*

In this tutorial, we will build our Authentication views and set up our app to interact with the API.

Now, that we have gotten that out of the way, LET THE CODING BEGIN!
